# programming-languages
Using some linear algebra techniques to find correlation between programming languages based on Github users.

I developed this as my Linear Algebra's final project.
The idea of finding which programming languages were somehow correlated amazed me.

## Thanks
I want to thank all graduate teaching assistants who helped me during the development of this project. I couldn't have done it without them.
